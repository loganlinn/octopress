Just finished the last project for my Internet Software Development
course (VT's CS4244). It compares the similarity between repositories
hosted on github. Repositories are scored based on similar commit
patterns. The two dimensions that are currently incorporated are hour
of the day and day of the week.

You can check out the project is at [http://gitcrunch.com](http://gitcrunch.com).

_Update: This is now offline. I will try to resurrect the project
sometime._
