    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As my friends are aware, I love <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> [1]. I was,
and still am, hungry to write more of it.  Shortly after putting up my
<a href="http://loganlinn.heroku.com">wimpy Rails app for blogging</a>, I had
a feeling that it wasn&#8217;t going to work that well. I realized I mainly
wrote the app to create something in Rails and deploy it on Heroku. Fun,
but not a long term solution. I got discouraged and <s>stopped</s>
failed to start blogging in hopes to build a system I would use.</p>

<p>Still trying to feed my Ruby appetite, I decided to use Sinatra to make
a super simple app that would serve my static
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> files. But
somewhere in between graduating and moving across the country, I lost
track of that project and its source code. I also learned about
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, which did everything I
wanted my app to do and more. I got discouraged again.</p>

<p>Today I learned about <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, a Sinatra
based framework that utilizes Jekyll. Described as an, &#8220;obsessively
designed framework&#8221;, I was delighted to find that it&#8217;s almost exactly
what I wanted to build myself. And since it&#8217;s a Rack app, it plays nice
with <a href="http://pow.cx/">pow</a>, another tool I&#8217;ve been looking for a reason
to use. So, shout out to <a href="https://github.com/imathis">Brandon Mathis</a>
and the Octopress contributors for making a great tool!</p>

<p>[1] They&#8217;ll also tell you that I have attention deficit disorder when it
comes to learning and using new programming languages.</p>
